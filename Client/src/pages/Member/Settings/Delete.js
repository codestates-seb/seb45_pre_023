                Before confirming that you would like your profile deleted, we`d
                like to take a moment to explain the implications of deletion:
                <br />
                <br />
              </text>
              <text>
                <li>
                  Deletion is irreversible, and you will have no way to regain
                  any of your original content, should this deletion be carried
                  out
                  <br />
                  and you change your mind later on.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Your questions and answers will remain on the site, but will
                  be disassociated and anonymized <br />
                  (the author will be listed as "user22355262") and will not
                  indicate your authorship even if you later return to the site.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                </li>
              </text>
              <text>
                Confirming deletion will only delete your profile on Stack
                Overflow - it will not affect any of your other profiles on the
                <br />
                Stack Exchange network. If you want to delete multiple profiles,
                you'll need to visit each site separately and request deletion
                <br />
                of those individual profiles.
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
              </text>
              <div className='flex'>
                <input type="checkbox" className='mr-4'></input>

                  I have read the information stated above and understand the
                  implications of having my profile deleted.  I wish to
                  proceed <br />with the deletion of my profile.
